// nodejs --> 
//event driven --> the interacttion of the user with the system --> event
// to the event done by the user if the program responds --> event driven
//Asynchronous --> the operations or functions in nodejs are executed parllely
// implemented in 2009 --> Ryan Dahl
//Node js is implemented upon the javaScript
// Node js --> has its own Run-time environment
// java Script --> in browser the program gets executed has no runtime environment
Node js Application ----> Event loop ---> File system 

                            ->Task1
                            ->Task2
                            ->Task3
                            ->Task4

--> the above event loop increases Asynchronous 

--> the programs gets executed by callback function
-->For InterDependent events --> Synchronous mode of execution
--> there should interconnection between the events.to determine the order of events --> callback function
--> throughput --> high for nodejs
--> Amount of data maintained in the application --> Scalability
-->CrossPlatform --> can run in any OS
--> Real Time --> goldPrice,weather,covid,--> can deal with real time data --> it has lot more repositories and libraries
-->php --> heavy weight process --> create a new process for every client request
--> nodejs --> uses threads --> light weight
--> Netflix --> using nodejs
-->npm --> node package manager
-->all the libraries are present inside the npm


-->code . --> to open the vscode
--> to configure the application we use --> npm init 

// callback functions
-->in callback function one parameter can be functionbody to another function
--> in this after the source definition is completed.it calls the parameterized function.indicating the source function is completed.


// Modules
-->Core Modules --> installed during installation of the nodejs
--> console
--> fs --> file system
--> os --> operating system

// JSON
//Stringify() --> converts object to array
--> parse() --> converts array to object
